Hi,
Let's do another small coding project.
I want to code a small SW to practice and improve musical pitch.

Description:
There is a GUI Where The user select:
* Which tonalliy including major or minor (DEFAULT is C)
* Which Cadence (I-IV-V-I, I-V-I, II-V-I). Default I-IV-V-I, I-V-I
* Which Note among the 12 chromatic note can be played after the cadence. I would like Check box for those.
* Then the user press a Start button

The software then play the audio file associate with the selected Cadende Type of the selected tonality followed by a random note picked among the selected notes.
The user then have 3 second to enter what he believe the note is.
The software then give an immediate feedback to the user (was his guest correct) and keep track all the result and the time it took.

After 20 round it shows the result for the session:
Keeping tack of all the session to see the improvement over time would be great.

I was thinking of an python+flask (or streamlite) like you sent me last time.
I'll provide the .WAV file for each cadence and each idividual note. In the code just put place holder like
I-IV-V-I in C.wav
A.wav
Ab.wav...

P.S


And a wave player.

* Which note was played, which note
* Which note the user gues.
* Are they the same Good
* how much time the user took to put in his answer.
.

Improvement
* out of time is ?
* Random Tonality,
* Random Cadence Type
* keyboard inpu.
